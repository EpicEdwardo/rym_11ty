All day, I feel the approach of dolphins; their thoughts are in my mind. <br />

When I swim, my cells attune to them, because ocean’s full of vibrations that transmit to water in my body. <br />

It’s a repository of primordial data from space; all creatures in water can access the Akasha. <br />

Tones entering my cells transform into feeling, an awareness of two worlds at once. <br />

I send back my thought, picture, feeling, and together we form new vibrations of knowledge that had been dormant in me. <br />

They’re here! <br />

I swim out of the cove toward them. <br />

So happy, I hum, and their answering chorus reverberates across water; we know each other. <br />
 
One dolphin is still, far below me. <br />

Her form takes shape, as she rises silently in bright blue, motionless, sunlit. <br />

Thank you for showing yourself, fulfilling a deep longing within my deep memory. <br />
<br />

I empty my mind and listen for her reply, which comes as waves of emotion.<br />

A cloud surrounds me; I expand into its stillness and receive tones conveying information very fast.<br />

They teach me to hum, to whistle and sing; sound amplifies my body across open water; even their joyous play has this sensation of creating space, and when they sleep, stars augment their frequencies.<br />

We converse by mind-cell helixes of image and feeling.<br />

Cosmic legacy, cosmic extension imprint holographically on my heart neurons as dolphin empathy.<br />

There are sounds which can stop time, alter surroundings or shift your dimension.<br />

Swimming I lose my sense of place, even physicality, and connect with collective love.<br />

They teach me to join my aura to the cosmos by spiraling with me in sound-star tetrahedrons and to love those with whom we merge.<br />

Then being is healing, through innocence, when the animal becomes the teacher.<br />
<br />

One dolphin swims toward me; I open telepathically and respond.<br />

I practice this method of reflection to contact life-forms in other space, who are trying however they can to meet us.<br />

Sirius radiates high frequencies to lighten the dark, denser planets.<br />

Dolphins travel to and from such a planet through diagrams like songs on ocean floors.<br />

They wish us to participate in over-lighting the collectivity of souls in our galaxy and ally with them to access the Space Sister-Brotherhood.<br />

Through these planetary vortices, dolphins catalyze starlight to refresh water on earth.<br />

Transference between species is both cellular and holographic or geometric.<br />

For example, my friend’s body is 3-D in front and 4-D in the back; she exists across dimensions, while appearing so ordinary in her yellow shirt and blue slacks, as we walk to the shore.<br />

“Memory is vibratory, like DNA, condensed light,” she volunteers.<br />

“You and I relate through our mutual past on Sirius, in Glastonbury, Santa Fe.”<br />

So I repeat their joyous, staccato syllables; I listen to “pod”casts of Noh singers and tune to high pitches the Pleiades use for propulsion into our atmosphere, using the star codes of dolphins.<br />
<br />

We’ve attributes in realities we’re not aware of.<br />

Dolphins reside in these dimensions, like dreams in oceans.<br />

They swim within magnetic streams of other entities, angels we’ve invented, others’ heavens, cyclic destiny.<br />

I glimpse one jump from its energy band, attracted by my friend’s intense aura.<br />

He shows me earth’s sister planet replicated by sound as we co-create it by singing, sitting in her yard, gazing at the ocean under pine trees.<br />

There are messages in clouds, in wavelets on granite, cicada and meadowlark calls.<br />

Space travelers materialize morphogenetically from local beauty and merge with us.<br />
They enable travel between time and stars by projecting tones just ahead of the consciousness of the person migrating, the way dolphins pass me so fast, I don’t see the bubbles until they’re far, out of sight.<br />
